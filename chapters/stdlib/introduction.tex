\chapter{Introduction}

This part defines the Intentio Standard Library (shortly \emph{stdlib}), its contents, semantics and the \emph{prelude} which is automatically imported in each Intentio program. This library provides essentials for building proper Intentio programs, some of which should be used by the language implementation through compiler intrinsics. For developer convenience it also provides common utilities which ease application development and make a standard for code interoperation. The standard library must be distributed with each implementation of the Intentio language.
