\chapter{Introduction}

This part defines the Intentio Standard Library (shortly \emph{stdlib}), its contents, semantics and the \emph{prelude} which is automatically imported in each Intentio program. This library provides essentials for building proper Intentio programs, some of which are used by the compiler through compiler intrinsics. It also provides for common convenience utilities which ease application development and make a standard for interoperation within code. The standard library must be distributed with each implementation of the Intentio language.
