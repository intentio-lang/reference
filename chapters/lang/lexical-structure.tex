\chapter{Lexical structure}

This chapter describes the lexical structure of Intentio. Most of the details may be skipped in a first reading of the reference.

In this chapter all whitespace is expressed explicitly in syntax descriptions, there is no implicit space between juxtaposed symbols. Terminal characters represent real characters in program source code.

Intentio program source is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode code points encoded in UTF-8, though most grammar rules are defined in terms of printable ASCII code points.
