\chapter{Modules and Assemblies}

A \emph{module}\index{module} is a collection of items, declared in an environment created by a set of \emph{imports} (items brought into scope from other modules). Module \emph{exports} some of its items, making them available to other modules.

Similarly to items, modules are also entirely determined at compile-time, remain fixed during execution, and may reside in read-only memory. This limitation does not apply to assemblies (including single module assemblies). It is possible to provide mechanisms to dynamically compile, link, load and unload assemblies at run-time.
