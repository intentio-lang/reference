\chapter{Modules and Assemblies}

Similarly to items, modules are also entirely determined at compile-time, remain fixed during execution, and may reside in read-only memory. This limitation does not apply to assemblies (including single module assemblies). It is possible to provide mechanisms to dynamically compile, link, load and unload assemblies at run-time.
